# Reo The Barber Website

This Website belongs to Reo The Baber who stays in Mrehwa. It serves as a marketing platform. It illustrates the types of hair cuts,prices, and facilities available. This will cover a wide range of customers hence more profit to be obtained. It as well enables customers to choose the hair cut and its price before they go to have their hair cut. Thus, I designed this website to solve the problem.
